### Weird computer issues [7/23/22]
I've had some weird power issues with this computer.  
  
The power button just doesn't turn it on most of the time, and sleep doesn't work right.
  
Also, I've had 2 MEMORY_MANAGEMENT BSODs and lots of firefox crashing for some reason. I ran the Windows Memory Diagnostic and it's all fine, but still.
  
Maybe it's my SSD? The SSD I have right now sucks, and I have a 512GB one on it's way.
  
Anyways, that's weird.
